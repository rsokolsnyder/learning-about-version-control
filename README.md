# Learning about Version Control

Author: Rebecca Sokol-Snyder

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I like version control because it is helpful to look back at previous code that I have written. I have found this useful when I am working on a complicated project where I have overwritten old code in favor of something more streamlined. Sometimes, the streamlined approach does not work as expected and version control allows me to see the previous version of my code and I can go back to it.

Version control can be frustrating when working with others who have different habits and practices in how they label and name their commit messages.
